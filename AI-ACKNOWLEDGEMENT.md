## Acknowledgement of AI Assistance

This software's development utilizes generative AI technologies as a tool to enhance productivity. The core functionality and architecture remain the product of human engineering.

**Scope of AI Use:**

*   AI assistance is primarily focused on code generation and refinement.
*   No AI-generated assets (e.g., images, audio, text content) are incorporated into the production version of this software.
*   Any AI-generated assets that may be present in the repository were either:
    *   Used as temporary placeholders during development and have been removed, or
    *   Created prior to the formalization of this acknowledgement and are not intended for production use.
*   All models used for code generation were either publicly available or trained exclusively on permissively licensed data.
